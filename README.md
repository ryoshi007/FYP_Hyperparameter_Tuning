# Final Year Project - Comparison of Hyperparameter Optimization Techniques ü§ñ  

## Overview üîé
This repository contains report, presentation slide, documentation, experiment results, Streamlit webpage code as well as a collection of optimization algorithms and tools designed to enhance the hyperparameter tuning process for machine learning models. Various optimization strategies are included, such as Grid Search, Half Grid Search, Simulated Annealing, and Genetic Algorithm. Additionally, it features functions to visualize the optimization process, aiding in analysis and decision-making.

## Getting Started üî®
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x  
- Scikit-learn (for model building and evaluation)  
- NumPy (for numerical operations)  
- Matplotlib (for plotting results)   

### How to Utilize Hyperparameter Optimization Techniques ü§î
1. Check out and download the desired .py files in 'HPO Experiment Codes' folder
2. Import the desired module and use the functions to optimize your machine learning models. Each module contains functions that can be directly applied to a dataset and a model. For example, to use the Grid Search:

`from grid_search import grid_search`

`best_params = grid_search(model, param_grid, X_train, y_train, scoring_metric)`

Refer to the streamlit website below for detailed usage instructions and insights gained from the project.
